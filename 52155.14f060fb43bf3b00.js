But it’s not just that. We’ve been working on it for over 5 years, starting as far back as Angular 4. And being fascinated by decomposition, we’ve spawned a multitude of independently helpful isolated libraries that allow us to build impressive Angular apps. While you might not be interested in using Taiga UI itself, these separate projects could definitely improve your Angular DX and provide you with amazingly useful tools.
