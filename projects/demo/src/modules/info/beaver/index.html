        <b>Beaver</b>
        is a set of components based on Taiga UI specifically designed for creating data-heavy dashboards/UIs for
        engineering services such as analytics/support ticket management/documentation or code platforms similar to
        Confluence/GitLab.
    </p>
    <p>
        These components follow stricter design guidelines and are more opinionated than the standard Taiga UI because
        they are tailored to specific use cases. Expect less flexibility or customization options.
